# Sets for the Eve Programmer

Sets are collections of unique, unordered elements. For example `{1, 2, 3}` is a set, but `{1, 1, 2, 3}` is not, because the element `1` appears twice. In Eve, every collection is a set, so it's important for Eve programmers to understand what sets are, what tools are available, and how these tools are used to compose sets. In this document, we'll go over what sets are, what you can do with them, and how you use them in Eve.

## Sets



### Notation
### Terminology

Cardinality - The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set. For example, the cardinality of the set `{1, 2, 3}` is `3`.

## Operations

Just as numbers can be combined with operators like plus ( + ) or times ( * ), sets have ther own special set of operators that define how sets can be combined and manipulated (e.g. union or intersection). 

### Set Union
### Set Intersection
### Set Difference
### Cartesian Product
