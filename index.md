## Install guide
Need to install Eve on your machine? [Head here](../install) for step-by-step directions.

## Quickstart
If you’re new to Eve and want a hands-on demo to learn the language, you can jump right in with a 5 minute [quickstart guide](../quickstart) that shows you how to build a simple incrementing counter.

## Syntax reference
Want a reminder how the syntax works or to get an overview of Eve without going through the quickstart? The [syntax reference](../syntax) is a good place to start.

## Libraries
Want to know everything Eve can do? [Here’s a list](../library) of all the functions, operators, and watchers available in the language.
